        Dusty Brigsby, a proud native of Fargo, ND, has worn many hats
        throughout his life. Starting with an honorable stint in the Navy as an

        DIY home project. Currently, he plays a pivotal role as an Assistive
        Technology Practitioner for Portland Public Schools, leveraging his
        detail-oriented nature and team-player spirit. Those who know Dusty

        knowledge, evident in his current journey of mastering React app
        development through the University of Oregon's Coding Bootcamp on EdX.
